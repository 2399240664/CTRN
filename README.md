# CTRN
An Improving Reasoning Network for Complex Question Answering over Temporal Knowledge Graphs.

I will post our all code and trained model.

We use TComplEx KG Embeddings as proposed in Tensor Decompositions for temporal knowledge base completion. We use a slightly modified version of their code from https://github.com/facebookresearch/tkbc
